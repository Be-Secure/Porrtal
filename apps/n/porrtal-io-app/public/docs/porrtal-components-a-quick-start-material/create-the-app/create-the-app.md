# Create the App

## ng new

In this tutorial, we will jump start our development using the @angular/cli `ng`.

You can find excellent documentation here
[angular.io/cli](https://angular.io/cli)

In the command below, a long project name was chosen to differentiate this app from other versions of the quick start - feel free to choose a project name you like.

### Open a terminal window

Note: Angular uses the [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) language. TypeScript is an excellent language choice for large scale development.

### Run the VS Code app

From VS Code, open the folder `porrtal-angular-material-quick-start` (or whatever app name you chose above).
